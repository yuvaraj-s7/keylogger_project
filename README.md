# Python Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger built in Python. It captures keyboard inputs and logs them to a file.

## How it works

The keylogger continuously monitors keyboard inputs using the `pynput` library in Python. When a key is pressed, the keylogger records the key and saves it to a log file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/yuvaraj-s7/keylogger_project.git

##Run the python file in cmd

python keylogger.py
